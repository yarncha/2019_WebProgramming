    <p>Time is a strange thing
      Only after it passes, you long for it
      A sweet dream, when you open your eyes, it may still be clear
      But soon, it gets far away and disappears lala
      You and I, this moment right here
      I’m going to cherish it deep in my heart
      The soft touch of your hand, even today’s air
      I’m gonna remember it all
      It’s so precious So make it count
      Remember this day
      When the gentle breeze blows and flowers bloom
      Each minute, each second, make it count
      Then I’ll be forever
      Gathering all the moments
      I’ll give it to you

      (La la la la)
      Even after time
      (La la la la)
      I really hope we make it count

      On a peaceful afternoon
      I’m laying on a bench, using your lap as a pillow
      This relaxed time is so sweet
      So the gravity is twice as strong here

      Each day feels so short
      Each day, longing rises again
      I wish I could stop time
      Whisper your heart to me

      So make it count
      Remember this day
      When the gentle breeze blows and flowers bloom
      Each minute, each second, make it count
      Then I’ll be forever
      Gathering all the moments
      I’ll give it to you

      (La la la la)
      Just like winter passes and snow melts
      When everything is so beautiful
      I’ll tell you once again
      Let’s be together in endless time, babe

      You’re so pretty, even moreso today

      So make it count
      Remember this day
      When the gentle breeze blows and flowers bloom
      Each minute, each second, make it count
      Then I’ll be forever
      Gathering all the moments
      I’ll give it to you

      (Even when today becomes yesterday, you’re by my side)
      Like the days I dreamed of
      (Stick close to me so I can’t even miss you)
      I’ll always protect you by your side
      (Even when today becomes yesterday, you’re by my side)
      Oh oh
      (Stick close to me so I can’t even miss you)
      I really hope we make it count</p>
